# Shop Dialogue & Hover Fixes - October 20, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ö° Dialogue Speed & Auto-Close
**Problems:**
- Dialogues typed too slowly (50ms per character)
- Dialogues stayed on screen too long (4 seconds)
- No consistent auto-close timing

**Solutions:**

#### Merchant Dialogue (General)
- **Typing Speed:** 50ms ‚Üí 15ms per character (3.3x faster!)
- **Auto-Close:** Added 2-second timer after typing completes
- **Effect:** Dialogues appear quickly and disappear automatically

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD
delay: 50, // Slow typing
// No auto-close timer

// NEW
delay: 15, // Fast typing - 3.3x faster!
// Auto-close after 2 seconds
this.time.delayedCall(2000, () => {
  if (this.dialogueContainer && this.dialogueContainer.active) {
    this.closeDialogueSmooth();
  }
});
```

#### Relic Dialogue (Item-Specific)
- **Display:** Instant (no typewriter effect)
- **Auto-Close:** 4 seconds ‚Üí 2 seconds
- **Effect:** Quick merchant comments that don't overstay

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD
this.time.delayedCall(4000, () => {
  this.closeDialogueSmooth();
});

// NEW
this.time.delayedCall(2000, () => {
  if (this.dialogueContainer && this.dialogueContainer.active) {
    this.closeDialogueSmooth();
  }
});
```

### 2. üéØ Hover Consistency on Grid Cards
**Problems:**
- Hover effects didn't work consistently on each card
- Cards sometimes got stuck in hover state
- Position reset was inconsistent for different cards in grid

**Root Cause:**
- Cards in scrollContainer have relative positions
- Original Y position wasn't reliably stored
- Closure variable `y` could get confused between cards

**Solution:**
- Store original Y position directly on container object
- Use stored position for all hover animations
- Ensures each card has its own reliable reference point

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Store original Y on container
(container as any).originalY = y;

// Use stored Y in hover
.on('pointerover', () => {
  const originalY = (container as any).originalY;
  this.tweens.add({
    targets: container,
    y: originalY - 5, // Lift 5px from original position
    duration: 200,
    ease: 'Power2'
  });
})
.on('pointerout', () => {
  const originalY = (container as any).originalY;
  this.tweens.add({
    targets: container,
    y: originalY, // Return to exact original position
    duration: 200,
    ease: 'Power2'
  });
});
```

## Technical Details

### Dialogue System Architecture
1. **Merchant Dialogue (showMerchantDialogue)**
   - Random rotation through general merchant phrases
   - Typewriter effect: 15ms per character
   - Auto-closes 2 seconds after completion
   - Can be manually closed by clicking

2. **Relic Dialogue (showRandomRelicDialogue ‚Üí showCustomMerchantDialogue)**
   - Context-specific comments about items
   - Instant display (no typewriter)
   - Auto-closes after 2 seconds
   - Triggered randomly (40% chance) on item click

### Hover System Architecture
- Each card stores `originalY` property
- `killTweensOf()` prevents animation conflicts
- Three simultaneous tweens:
  1. Glow effect (outerGlow alpha + scale)
  2. Accent brightness (topBar alpha)
  3. Position lift (container Y)
- All tweens reference stored `originalY` for consistency

## Testing Checklist

### Dialogue Speed
- [x] Merchant dialogue types fast (15ms)
- [x] Merchant dialogue auto-closes after 2s
- [x] Relic dialogue shows instantly
- [x] Relic dialogue auto-closes after 2s
- [x] Both dialogues closable by clicking

### Hover Consistency
- [x] First card in grid hovers properly
- [x] Last card in grid hovers properly
- [x] Middle cards hover properly
- [x] Rapid hover in/out works smoothly
- [x] Cards return to exact original position
- [x] No cards get stuck in hover state
- [x] Works across all rows of grid

## Visual Results

**Before:**
- ‚ùå Slow typewriter effect (50ms)
- ‚ùå Dialogues stay too long (4s)
- ‚ùå Hover inconsistent across grid
- ‚ùå Cards sometimes stuck hovering

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Fast dialogue display (15ms typewriter)
- ‚úÖ Dialogues auto-close in 2 seconds
- ‚úÖ Every card hovers consistently
- ‚úÖ Smooth reset to original position
- ‚úÖ No stuck states

## Performance Notes

- Killing tweens before starting new ones prevents memory buildup
- Storing originalY on container is lightweight and reliable
- 2-second auto-close prevents UI clutter
- Fast typewriter (15ms) feels responsive without being jarring

## Files Modified
- `Shop.ts` - Dialogue timing and hover position tracking
