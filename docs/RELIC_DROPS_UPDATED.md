# Relic Drop System - Updated with Specific Mythological Relics ✅

## Overview
Updated the relic drop system to give **specific relics based on enemy mythology** instead of random relics. Each enemy now drops their own mythological relic, and dropped relics are now **displayed in the rewards UI**.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **CombatDialogue.ts** - Specific Relics for Each Enemy

Changed from random relic selection to mythology-based specific relics:

#### Common Enemies → Mythological Relics (35% drop chance):

| Enemy | Relic Dropped | Mythology Connection |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| 🐴 Tikbalang Scout | 🐴 **Tikbalang's Hoof** (+15% dodge) | Horse-headed trickster |
| 🌳 Balete Wraith | 🌳 **Balete Root** (+3 Block per Lupa card) | Sacred spirit trees |
| 🐐 Sigbin Charger | 🐐 **Sigbin Heart** (+8 damage on 40+ bursts) | Heart-stealing creature |
| 🧚 Duwende Trickster | 🧚 **Duwende Charm** (+20% resist Weak) | Fortune-granting goblin |
| 💧 Tiyanak Ambusher | 💧 **Tiyanak Tear** (Immune to first Fear) | Crying infant spirit |
| 🪲 Amomongo | 🪲 **Amomongo Claw** (+4 bleed damage) | Long-nailed ape |
| 👹 Bungisngis | 👹 **Bungisngis Grin** (+8 damage vs debuffed) | Laughing giant |

#### Elite Enemies → Mythological Relics (75% drop chance):

| Enemy | Relic Dropped | Mythology Connection |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| 🚬 Kapre Shade | 🚬 **Kapre's Cigar** (Summon 12 damage minion) | Tree giant smoker |
| 💨 Tawong Lipod | 💨 **Wind Veil** (+1 draw per Hangin card) | Invisible wind being |

#### Boss Enemy → Mythological Relic (100% guaranteed):

| Enemy | Relic Dropped | Mythology Connection |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| 🔮 Mangangaway (Boss) | 🪄 **Mangangaway Wand** (Immune to first Curse) | Sorcerer with hex magic |

---

### 2. **Combat.ts** - Rewards UI Now Shows Dropped Relics

Added relic display to the rewards screen (lines ~1975-2015):

```typescript
// Relic drop display
if (reward.relics && reward.relics.length > 0) {
  // Check if relic was actually dropped
  const droppedRelic = this.combatState.player.relics[this.combatState.player.relics.length - 1];
  const rewardRelic = reward.relics[0];
  
  // If the last relic in player's inventory matches the reward relic, it was dropped
  if (droppedRelic && droppedRelic.id === rewardRelic.id) {
    // Show relic emoji and name
    this.add.text(screenWidth/2, rewardY, `${rewardRelic.emoji} Relic: ${rewardRelic.name}`, {
      fontFamily: "dungeon-mode",
      fontSize: Math.floor(16 * scaleFactor),
      color: "#a29bfe",  // Purple for relic
      align: "center",
    }).setOrigin(0.5);
    
    // Show relic description
    this.add.text(screenWidth/2, rewardY + 25, rewardRelic.description, {
      fontFamily: "dungeon-mode",
      fontSize: Math.floor(12 * scaleFactor),
      color: "#95a5a6",  // Gray for description
      align: "center",
      wordWrap: { width: screenWidth * 0.7 }
    }).setOrigin(0.5);
  } else {
    // Relic drop failed
    this.add.text(screenWidth/2, rewardY, `❌ No relic dropped`, {
      fontFamily: "dungeon-mode",
      fontSize: Math.floor(14 * scaleFactor),
      color: "#7f8c8d",
      align: "center",
    }).setOrigin(0.5);
  }
}
```

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/game/scenes/combat/CombatDialogue.ts`**
   - Changed import from random relic functions to `RELIC_REGISTRY`
   - Updated all 10 enemy dialogues to use `RELIC_REGISTRY.getById()` with specific relic IDs
   - Removed randomization, each enemy now drops their specific mythological relic

2. **`src/game/scenes/Combat.ts`**
   - Added relic drop display in `showRewardsScreen()` method
   - Shows relic emoji, name, and description if dropped
   - Shows "❌ No relic dropped" if drop failed
   - Purple color (#a29bfe) for relic names
   - Gray color (#95a5a6) for relic descriptions

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Each enemy has specific mythological relic assigned
- [x] Relic IDs match those in RELIC_REGISTRY
- [x] Drop chances configured (35% common, 75% elite, 100% boss)
- [x] Rewards UI displays dropped relics with emoji and description
- [x] Rewards UI shows "No relic dropped" when drop fails
- [x] All 10 enemies have mythology-accurate relic connections

---

## Console Output Examples

### Successful Drop:
```
Relic drop roll: 0.23 vs 0.35
✅ Relic dropped: Tikbalang's Hoof (🐴)
Added relic to inventory. Total relics: 3/6
```

### Failed Drop:
```
Relic drop roll: 0.89 vs 0.35
❌ Relic drop failed (rolled 0.89, needed ≤0.35)
```

---

## Benefits of This Update

### ✅ Before (Random System):
- ❌ Tikbalang could drop any common relic
- ❌ No thematic connection between enemy and reward
- ❌ Unpredictable, harder to build strategies
- ❌ Less immersive storytelling

### ✅ After (Specific System):
- ✅ Tikbalang always drops Tikbalang's Hoof (if successful)
- ✅ Direct mythology connection reinforces lore
- ✅ Players can target specific enemies for specific relics
- ✅ More immersive and thematically consistent
- ✅ Rewards UI shows what you got (or didn't get)

---

## Player Strategy Impact

Players can now:
1. **Plan builds** - "I need Tikbalang's Hoof for dodge build, let me fight Tikbalang Scouts"
2. **Learn mythology** - Each relic teaches about Filipino creatures
3. **See drop results** - Immediate feedback on success/failure
4. **Build thematic decks** - Collect related mythological relics

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Add relic drop rate display in enemy info screen
- [ ] Add "relic guaranteed on next drop" after X failures (pity system)
- [ ] Add relic drop animation/celebration
- [ ] Add relic compendium showing which enemies drop which relics
- [ ] Add achievement for collecting all mythological relics

---
