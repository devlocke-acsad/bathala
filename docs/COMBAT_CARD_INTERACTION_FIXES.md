# Combat Card Interaction Bugfixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all bug fixes related to card selection and sorting in the Combat scene, addressing user-reported issues with card interaction consistency.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Card Selection State Persistence
**Problem**: Cards remained visually selected after being discarded or played.

**Solution**: 
- Clear `selected` flag on cards BEFORE moving them to discard/played piles
- Synchronize `selectedCards` array with individual card flags
- Clear tints and kill tweens before destroying sprites

### 2. Spam-Clicking Sort Buttons
**Problem**: Multiple sort animations would run simultaneously, causing card misalignment and position conflicts.

**Solution**:
- Added `isSorting` boolean flag to prevent concurrent sort operations
- Disable card interactions during sorting animation
- Only allow one sort operation at a time

### 3. Wrong Card Selected After Sorting
**Problem**: After sorting, clicking a card would select a different card than the one clicked.

**Solution**:
- Call `updateHandDisplay()` after sorting completes
- This destroys old card sprites (with stale event listeners)
- Recreates sprites with fresh listeners referencing the correct sorted cards

### 4. Card Selection During Combat Transitions
**Problem**: Cards could be selected during enemy turns, animations, or when combat ended.

**Solution**:
- Added phase guards to `selectCard()` method
- Block selection during: action processing, card drawing, combat end, and sorting
- Only allow selection during `player_turn` phase

## Files Modified

1. **Combat.ts**
   - Added `isSorting` state flag and getter
   - Enhanced `selectCard()` with phase and state guards
   - Enhanced `sortHand()` with debouncing and interaction disabling
   - Fixed `discardSelectedCards()` to clear state before moving cards
   - Fixed `playSelectedCards()` to clear state on played cards

2. **CombatUI.ts**
   - Enhanced `updateHandDisplay()` to kill tweens and clear tints
   - Enhanced `updateHandDisplayQuiet()` with same fixes
   - Enhanced `createCardSprite()` to validate card existence and remove old listeners
   - Added sorting state checks to sort button hover and click handlers

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `CARD_SELECTION_BUGFIXES.md`
   - Created `SORT_BUTTON_BUGFIXES.md`
   - Created this summary document

## Code Patterns Established

### State Management Rules
1. ✅ Always clear `selected` flag before moving cards between zones
2. ✅ Always synchronize `selectedCards` array with card flags
3. ✅ Always kill tweens before destroying sprites
4. ✅ Always clear visual states (tints) before destroying sprites
5. ✅ Always remove listeners before recreating interactive elements

### Phase Guards Pattern
```typescript
if (this.isActionProcessing || this.isDrawingCards || this.combatEnded || this.isSorting) {
  return; // Block interaction
}

if (this.combatState.phase !== "player_turn") {
  return; // Only allow during player turn
}
```

### Debouncing Pattern
```typescript
if (this.isSorting) {
  return; // Already in progress
}

this.isSorting = true;
// ... perform operation ...
this.isSorting = false;
```

### Listener Refresh Pattern
```typescript
// After reordering data/sprites, refresh UI to recreate listeners
this.ui.updateHandDisplay(); // Destroys old sprites + listeners, creates new ones
```

## Testing Results

All tests passing:
- ✅ Card selection/deselection works correctly
- ✅ Discard clears selection properly
- ✅ Play cards clears selection properly
- ✅ Turn transitions clear selection
- ✅ Cannot spam-click sort buttons
- ✅ Cannot select cards during sorting
- ✅ Correct card selected after sorting
- ✅ Cannot select cards during wrong phase
- ✅ Rapid clicking handled gracefully
- ✅ No visual artifacts or state leaks

## Performance Impact

**Negligible**:
- Boolean flag checks are O(1)
- Sprite recreation already happens frequently in the game
- Prevented redundant operations (multiple sorts) actually improves performance
- No degradation in frame rate or responsiveness

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Consistency**: Card selection now behaves predictably across all scenarios
2. **Responsiveness**: Sort buttons provide clear feedback and prevent spam
3. **Correctness**: Clicking a card always selects that specific card
4. **Polish**: No visual glitches or state inconsistencies

## Related Issues Resolved

- Card selection bugs when discarding
- Card selection bugs when playing hands
- Sort button spam causing animation conflicts
- Wrong cards being selected after sorting
- Cards responding to clicks during animations
- Selection state persisting across turns

## Prevention Measures

Going forward, all card interaction code should follow these principles:

1. **Always guard against concurrent operations** (use state flags)
2. **Always validate phase** before allowing player interactions
3. **Always refresh UI** after data reordering (to sync listeners)
4. **Always clean up visual state** before destroying sprites
5. **Always synchronize arrays** with individual object flags

## Recommended Code Review Checklist

When adding new card interactions, verify:
- [ ] Phase guards are in place
- [ ] State flags prevent concurrent operations
- [ ] Listeners reference current data, not stale closures
- [ ] Visual states are cleaned up properly
- [ ] Arrays are synchronized with object properties
- [ ] Tweens are killed before sprite destruction

## Future Architectural Improvements

Consider implementing:

1. **State Machine for Card Lifecycle**
   ```
   UNSELECTED → SELECTED → PLAYED/DISCARDED → DESTROYED
   ```

2. **Event System for Card State Changes**
   ```typescript
   card.on('stateChange', (newState) => {
     // Update sprite visuals
     // Update selections array
     // Emit analytics event
   });
   ```

3. **Centralized Interaction Manager**
   ```typescript
   class CardInteractionManager {
     canSelectCard(): boolean
     canSortHand(): boolean
     canDiscardCards(): boolean
   }
   ```

These would make state management more explicit and easier to debug.
