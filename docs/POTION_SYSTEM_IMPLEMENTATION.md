## Design Philosophy

The potion system follows the game's existing design patterns:
- **Prologue-style UI**: Double borders, retro aesthetic
- **Color Coding**: Cyan for potions (vs. gray for relics)
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Prevents accidental usage
- **Limited Inventory**: Max 3 potions encourages strategic decisions
- **Visual Feedback**: Healing indicators, success messages
- **Persistence**: Potions saved across scenes and sessions

---

## Integration with Existing Systems

### GameState
- Potions are part of player data structure
- Automatically saved/loaded with game state
- Persists across scene transitions

### Treasure System
- Seamlessly integrated into existing reward flow
- Doesn't replace relics, adds bonus chance
- Respects inventory limits

### Combat System
- Uses existing UI patterns (CombatUI class)
- Follows same interaction model as relics
- Reuses healing indicator system

### Overworld System
- Uses existing inventory display
- Matches relic UI styling
- Reuses tooltip system

---

## Conclusion

The potion system is fully functional and ready for use. Players can now find healing potions in treasure chests, use them in combat via a confirmation modal, and see them displayed in both combat and overworld UIs. The system is designed to be expandable for future potion types and effects.
