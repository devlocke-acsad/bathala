## Files Modified

### 1. **Treasure.ts**
**Change**: Increased potion drop rate to 80%

```typescript
// OLD: 30% chance
if (this.player.potions.length < 3 && Math.random() < 0.3) {

// NEW: 80% chance  
if (this.player.potions.length < 3 && Math.random() < 0.8) {
  const healingPotion = commonPotions.find(p => p.id === "healing_potion");
  if (healingPotion) {
    this.player.potions.push(healingPotion);
    potionMessage = " + Healing Potion!";
  }
}
```

**Result**: 
- Very high chance (80%) to find potion in treasure
- Only Healing Potion drops (no other types)
- Max 3 potions enforced

---

### 2. **Combat.ts**
**Change**: Removed starting test potions

```typescript
// OLD: Started with 3 test potions
potions: [
  commonPotions[0], // Potion of Clarity
  commonPotions[1], // Elixir of Fortitude
  commonPotions[2], // Draught of Swiftness
],

// NEW: Start with empty potion inventory
potions: [], // Start with no potions - gain from treasure chests
```

**Result**: 
- New games start with 0 potions
- Must find potions in treasure chests

---

### 3. **Overworld.ts**
**Change**: Removed starting potions (2 instances)

```typescript
// OLD: Started with 2 potions (Clarity, Fortitude)
potions: [
  { id: "clarity_potion", name: "Potion of Clarity", ... },
  { id: "fortitude_potion", name: "Elixir of Fortitude", ... }
],

// NEW: Start with empty potion inventory
potions: [], // Start with no potions - gain from treasure chests
```

**Result**:
- Overworld already displays potions using emoji from data
- `potion.emoji` correctly shows ❤️ for healing potion
- No changes needed to display logic

---

## Current Behavior

### **Acquisition Flow**
1. Player finds treasure chest in Overworld
2. Opens treasure chest → Treasure scene
3. Selects a relic
4. **80% chance**: Also receives Healing Potion (if room available)
5. Message: "Acquired: [Relic] + Healing Potion!"
6. Returns to Overworld with new items

### **Combat Usage**
1. Potion appears in right-side inventory (3 vertical slots)
2. Click potion → Confirmation modal opens
3. Choose YES → Heals 20 HP, potion consumed
4. Choose CANCEL → Modal closes, potion kept

### **Overworld Display**
1. Potions shown in left panel (horizontal 3 slots)
2. Displays emoji: ❤️ for Healing Potion
3. Hover shows tooltip with name and description
4. Cannot be used outside combat

---

## Design Rationale

### **Why 80% Drop Rate?**
- **Player-Friendly**: Ensures regular potion acquisition
- **Not Guaranteed**: 20% failure keeps exploration meaningful
- **Balanced**: Limited to 3 slots prevents hoarding

### **Why Healing-Only?**
- **Simplicity**: New players understand "heal 20 HP" immediately
- **Universal Value**: Always useful, unlike situational effects
- **Focused Design**: One clear purpose per item type

### **Why Start with 0 Potions?**
- **Progression**: Players feel rewarded for finding potions
- **Resource Scarcity**: Makes early game more strategic
- **Tutorial Clarity**: Teaches potion system through discovery

### **Why Use Emoji Display?**
- **Visual Clarity**: ❤️ instantly communicates "healing"
- **Space Efficient**: Small slots still readable
- **Consistent**: Matches relic display style
