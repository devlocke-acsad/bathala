## 🎓 Thesis Validation Status

### Validated Claims ✅
- [x] "Performance-based PPS calculation"
- [x] "Tier-based difficulty adjustment"
- [x] "Combat enemy scaling"
- [x] "Complete economic scaling" (shop + gold rewards)
- [x] "Transparent, rule-based system"
- [x] "Calibration period prevents volatility"

### Pending Validation ❌
- [ ] "Adaptive map generation bias"
- [ ] "Complete roguelike progression scaling"
- [ ] "AI complexity scaling by tier"

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Core algorithm and economic systems are complete
- **Medium Risk:** Static map generation somewhat contradicts adaptive design
- **Low Risk:** Missing AI complexity is non-critical for thesis

## 🔧 Quick Reference: DDA Integration Pattern

### Standard Integration Template
```typescript
// 1. Import DDA
import { RuleBasedDDA } from "../../core/dda/RuleBasedDDA";

// 2. Get adjustment in method
const dda = RuleBasedDDA.getInstance();
const adjustment = dda.getCurrentDifficultyAdjustment();

// 3. Apply multiplier
const scaledValue = Math.round(baseValue * adjustment.MULTIPLIER_NAME);

// 4. Log for thesis
console.log(`DDA System [Item]: ${baseValue} → ${scaledValue} (${adjustment.tier})`);
```

### Available Multipliers
```typescript
adjustment.enemyHealthMultiplier   // ✅ Used in Combat
adjustment.enemyDamageMultiplier   // ✅ Used in Combat
adjustment.shopPriceMultiplier     // ✅ Used in Shop
adjustment.goldRewardMultiplier    // ✅ Used in Combat (NEW!)
adjustment.restNodeBias           // ❌ Available, not used
```
