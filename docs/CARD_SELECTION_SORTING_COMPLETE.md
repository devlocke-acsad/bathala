# Complete Card Selection & Sorting Fixes - Final Summary

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ ALL BUGS FIXED

---

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Card Selection State Persistence
**Problem**: Cards remained visually selected after being discarded or played  
**Fixed**: Clear selection state BEFORE moving cards to discard/played piles

### 2. ✅ Sort Button Spam Clicking  
**Problem**: Multiple sort animations ran simultaneously  
**Fixed**: Added `isSorting` flag to debounce and block concurrent sorts

### 3. ✅ Wrong Card Selected After Sorting
**Problem**: Clicking a card after sorting selected a different card  
**Fixed**: `updateHandDisplay()` after sort recreates sprites with fresh event listeners

### 4. ✅ Selection Lost During Phase Transitions
**Problem**: Cards could be selected during enemy turns or animations  
**Fixed**: Phase guards block selection except during player_turn

### 5. ✅ Selected Cards Lose Visual State When Sorting (FINAL FIX)
**Problem**: Selected cards kept white border but lost yellow tint and raised position when sorting  
**Fixed**: `updateHandDisplay()` now applies ALL visual effects when recreating sprites:
- ✅ Raised position (baseY - 40)
- ✅ Yellow tint (0xffdd44)
- ✅ Increased depth (500 + index)
- ✅ White border (already handled)

---

## Complete Solution Architecture

### State Preservation Flow (Combat.ts)
```typescript
sortHand() {
  1. Check isSorting flag → return if already sorting
  2. Check phase/state guards → only allow during player_turn
  3. Set isSorting = true
  4. Save selectedCardIdentities (suit, rank, id) ← PRESERVE STATE
  5. Disable card interactions
  6. Run animation
  7. AFTER animation:
     - Restore selection state to reordered cards
     - updateHandDisplay() → recreate sprites with visuals
     - updateSelectionCounter()
     - updateHandIndicator()
     - Set isSorting = false
}
```

### Visual Application Flow (CombatUI.ts)
```typescript
updateHandDisplay() {
  1. Kill tweens, clear tints, destroy old sprites
  2. For each card in hand:
     - Calculate base position (x, baseY, rotation)
     - Check if card.selected === true
     - If selected:
       ✓ Position at baseY - 40 (raised)
       ✓ Apply yellow tint (0xffdd44)
       ✓ Set depth 500 + index (front)
     - If not selected:
       ✓ Position at baseY (normal)
       ✓ No tint
       ✓ Set depth 100 + index (normal)
     - Create sprite with correct visuals
     - Add to hand container
}
```

## Key Code Changes

### 1. Combat.ts - sortHand() Enhancement
```typescript
// Store selection BEFORE sorting
const selectedCardIdentities = this.selectedCards.map(card => ({
  suit: card.suit,
  rank: card.rank,
  id: card.id
}));

// Animation callback
this.animations.animateCardShuffle(sortBy, () => {
  // Restore selection AFTER sorting
  this.selectedCards = [];
  this.combatState.player.hand.forEach(card => {
    const wasSelected = selectedCardIdentities.some(
      identity => identity.suit === card.suit && 
                  identity.rank === card.rank && 
                  identity.id === card.id
    );
    if (wasSelected) {
      card.selected = true;
      this.selectedCards.push(card);
    }
  });
  
  // Update display with correct visuals
  this.ui.updateHandDisplay();
  this.updateSelectionCounter();
  this.ui.updateHandIndicator();
  this.isSorting = false;
});
```

### 2. CombatUI.ts - updateHandDisplay() Visual Application
```typescript
hand.forEach((card, index) => {
  // Calculate positions
  const baseY = -Math.abs(normalizedPos) * CARD_ARC_HEIGHT * 2;
  
  // Store base position on card
  (card as any).baseY = baseY;
  
  // APPLY RAISED POSITION IF SELECTED
  const y = card.selected ? baseY - 40 : baseY;
  
  // Create sprite at correct position
  const cardSprite = this.createCardSprite(card, x, y);
  cardSprite.setAngle(rotation);
  
  // APPLY VISUAL EFFECTS IF SELECTED
  if (card.selected) {
    const cardImage = cardSprite.list[0] as Phaser.GameObjects.Image | Phaser.GameObjects.Rectangle;
    if (cardImage && 'setTint' in cardImage) {
      cardImage.setTint(0xffdd44); // YELLOW TINT
    }
    cardSprite.setDepth(500 + index); // BRING TO FRONT
  } else {
    cardSprite.setDepth(100 + index);
  }
});
```

### 3. CombatUI.ts - Removed State Modification
```typescript
// REMOVED - Don't modify state in display methods
// hand.forEach(card => {
//   card.selected = false;
// });

// NEW - Display methods just render current state
```

## Complete Visual Effects Checklist

When `card.selected === true`, the following effects are applied:

| Effect | Value | Applied By | When |
|--------|-------|-----------|------|
| **Position Y** | baseY - 40 | updateHandDisplay() | Always |
| **Tint** | 0xffdd44 (yellow) | updateHandDisplay() | Always |
| **Depth** | 500 + index | updateHandDisplay() | Always |
| **Border** | White outline | createCardSprite() | Always |

All effects persist through:
- ✅ Sort by Rank
- ✅ Sort by Suit
- ✅ Multiple rapid sort operations
- ✅ Selecting/deselecting other cards during sort

---

## Testing Results

### Selection Persistence
✅ Select cards → Discard → Selection cleared  
✅ Select cards → Play → Selection cleared  
✅ Turn transition → Selection cleared  
✅ New cards drawn → Not selected  

### Sort Debouncing
✅ Spam click Rank → Only one sort runs  
✅ Spam click Suit → Only one sort runs  
✅ Click Rank then Suit rapidly → Second blocked  
✅ Cards not clickable during sort  

### Correct Card Selection
✅ Sort by Rank → Click first card → Selects correct card  
✅ Sort by Suit → Click first card → Selects correct card  
✅ Sort multiple times → Always selects clicked card  

### Visual State Persistence  
✅ Select 3 cards → Sort by Rank → All 3 remain visually selected  
✅ Select 3 cards → Sort by Suit → All 3 remain visually selected  
✅ Selected cards have yellow tint after sort  
✅ Selected cards are raised after sort  
✅ Selected cards have white border after sort  
✅ Selected cards are in front (depth) after sort  
✅ All 4 visual effects present simultaneously

## Design Principles Established

### 1. State-Render Separation
- **Game logic methods** (Combat.ts) manage state
- **Display methods** (CombatUI.ts) render current state
- Display methods DO NOT modify state (except during initialization)

### 2. Visual Consistency
- Selected state has 4 visual effects that ALWAYS appear together
- All effects applied in same location for maintainability
- Effects persist across all UI updates

### 3. Debouncing Pattern
- Use boolean flags to prevent concurrent operations
- Check flag at operation start, set during, clear after
- Disable interactions during operations

### 4. State Preservation
- Identify what needs to persist (selection, position, etc.)
- Save before operation that might destroy references
- Restore after operation completes

---

## Performance Impact

**Minimal to None**:
- Boolean checks are O(1)
- Sprite recreation already happens frequently
- Prevented redundant operations (multiple sorts)
- No degradation in frame rate or responsiveness

---

## User Experience Improvements

1. ✅ **Predictable**: Cards behave consistently in all scenarios
2. ✅ **Visual Clarity**: Selected cards always look selected
3. ✅ **Responsive**: No lag or conflicts from spam clicking
4. ✅ **Correct**: Clicking a card always selects that specific card
5. ✅ **Polished**: No visual glitches or state mismatches

---

## Future Architectural Recommendations

### State Machine for Card Lifecycle
```typescript
enum CardState {
  IN_DECK,
  IN_HAND_UNSELECTED,
  IN_HAND_SELECTED,
  IN_PLAYED_HAND,
  IN_DISCARD,
  BEING_SORTED,
  BEING_ANIMATED
}

class CardStateManager {
  transition(card: Card, from: CardState, to: CardState) {
    // Validate transition
    // Update visual state
    // Emit events
  }
}
```

### Event-Driven Updates
```typescript
card.on('selected', () => this.applySelectionVisuals(card));
card.on('deselected', () => this.removeSelectionVisuals(card));
card.on('sorted', () => this.updateSortedPosition(card));
```
