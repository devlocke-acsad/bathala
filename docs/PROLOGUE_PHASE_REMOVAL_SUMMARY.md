# Prologue Tutorial Phase Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### Phases Removed
- **Phase 6: Status Effects** - Removed teaching of buffs, debuffs, Strength, Vulnerable, Weak, Burn, etc.
- **Phase 8: Enemy Intents** - Removed teaching of enemy intent system and turn prediction

### Rationale
These mechanics were introducing complexity too early in the tutorial. The focus should be on core mechanics first (cards, hands, actions, discard, items, moral choices) before introducing advanced status systems.

### New Tutorial Structure

**Before (11 Phases):**
1. Welcome
2. Understanding Cards
3. Hand Types and Bonuses
4. Combat Actions
5. Discard Mechanic
6. ~~Status Effects~~ ❌ REMOVED
7. Items
8. ~~Enemy Intents~~ ❌ REMOVED
9. Moral Choice
10. Advanced Concepts
11. Final Trial

**After (9 Phases):**
1. Welcome
2. Understanding Cards
3. Hand Types and Bonuses
4. Combat Actions
5. Discard Mechanic
6. Items (formerly Phase 7)
7. Moral Choice (formerly Phase 9)
8. Advanced Concepts (formerly Phase 10)
9. Final Trial (formerly Phase 11)

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. **TutorialManager.ts**
   - Commented out imports for Phase 6 and Phase 8
   - Removed phases from the phases array with explanatory comments
   - Tutorial now initializes with 9 phases instead of 11

2. **Progress Indicators Updated** (All phases)
   - Phase 1-5: Updated from "X of 11" to "X of 9"
   - Phase 7 → 6: Updated from "7 of 11" to "6 of 9"
   - Phase 9 → 7: Updated from "9 of 11" to "7 of 9"
   - Phase 10 → 8: Updated from "10 of 11" to "8 of 9"
   - Phase 11 → 9: Updated from "11 of 11" to "9 of 9"

3. **Phase 4 Combat Actions**
   - Removed enemy intent display
   - Removed buff/debuff references from action descriptions
   - Simplified to show only core mechanics

## UI Impact

### Progress Bar
Players will now see progress indicators reflecting 9 phases:
- "Phase 1 of 9" instead of "Phase 1 of 11"
- "Phase 6 of 9" (Items) instead of "Phase 7 of 11"
- etc.

### Tutorial Length
- Reduced from 11 phases to 9 phases
- Approximately 15-20% shorter tutorial
- More focused on essential mechanics

## Future Considerations

### When to Re-introduce These Mechanics
1. **Status Effects**: Could be introduced during first real combat encounter after tutorial
2. **Enemy Intents**: Could be shown with tooltip on first encounter, then expanded in Chapter 1

### Alternative Teaching Methods
- In-game tooltips during first encounter with each mechanic
- Optional "Advanced Tutorial" accessible from main menu
- Contextual help during actual gameplay encounters
- Chronicle/Codex entries that players can reference
