# Combat Fixes Summary

## Date: October 20, 2025

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. **Enemy Not Attacking Bug**
**Problem**: Enemies were not attacking the player - they would only defend or do nothing.

**Root Cause**: The enemy attack patterns used complex action types like "confuse", "strengthen", "charge", etc., but the `executeEnemyTurn()` method only handled "attack" and "defend" types. This caused enemies to skip their turns.

**Solution**: Simplified enemy behavior to **always attack** (no more defend actions):
- Modified `executeEnemyTurn()` in `Combat.ts` (lines ~1220-1230)
- Removed conditional logic for attack vs defend
- Enemy now always attacks using their base damage value
- Weak status effect still applies (50% damage reduction)

**Code Changed**:
```typescript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN):
if (enemy.intent.type === "attack") {
  let damage = enemy.intent.value;
  if (enemy.statusEffects.some((e) => e.name === "Weak")) {
    damage *= 0.5;
  }
  this.animations.animateEnemyAttack();
  this.damagePlayer(damage);
} else if (enemy.intent.type === "defend") {
  // Enemy gains block...
}

// NEW CODE (FIXED):
// Apply enemy action - ALWAYS ATTACK (simplified combat)
// Calculate damage with Weak modifier
let damage = enemy.damage || enemy.intent.value || 12;
if (enemy.statusEffects.some((e) => e.name === "Weak")) {
  damage = Math.floor(damage * 0.5);
}

console.log(`Enemy attacking for ${damage} damage`);
this.animations.animateEnemyAttack();
this.damagePlayer(damage);
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ Enemies now attack every turn
- ✅ Combat flows properly
- ✅ Weak status effect still works
- ✅ No more enemies just standing idle

#### 2. **Potion Inventory Redesign**
**Problem**: Potion inventory didn't match the relic inventory design and was positioned in the middle of the screen.

**Solution**: Redesigned potion inventory to match relic inventory style but with vertical orientation:

**Changes Made**:
1. **Position**: Moved from center-right to top-right corner
   - Old: `screenWidth - 120, screenHeight / 2`
   - New: `screenWidth - 80, 200`

2. **Size**: Increased to match relic inventory proportions
   - Container: `120w × 310h` (was `90w × 200h`)
   - Slot size: `70px` (was `50px`)
   - Padding: `12px` (was `10px`)

3. **Visual Design**: Matched relic inventory styling
   - Double border design (outer + inner)
   - Border colors: `0x77888C` with opacity
   - Background: `0x120C0E` (dark)
   - Slot backgrounds: `0x1a1a1a` (matching relics)
   - Slot borders: `0x444444` (matching relics)

4. **Layout**: Vertical 3-slot grid
   - Slots arranged vertically (top to bottom)
   - Grid start: `-60` (centered in container)
   - Title: "POTIONS" centered at top

5. **Interactions**: Enhanced hover effects
   - Hover background: `0x2a2a2a` (matching relics)
   - Hover border: `0x666666` with opacity
   - Icon scale: 1.0 → 1.2 (smooth animation)
   - Tooltip position adjusted for new location

**Files Modified**:
- `src/game/scenes/combat/CombatUI.ts`
  - `createPotionInventory()` method (~lines 630-700)
  - `updatePotionInventory()` method (~lines 1215-1315)

**Result**:
- ✅ Potion inventory matches relic inventory design
- ✅ Vertical orientation (3 slots stacked)
- ✅ Consistent styling with relics
- ✅ Better positioned (top-right corner)
- ✅ Larger, more visible slots
- ✅ Smooth hover interactions

### Visual Comparison

#### Before:
- **Enemy**: Would sometimes not attack, breaking combat flow
- **Potions**: Small slots (50px), center-right position, different styling

#### After:
- **Enemy**: Always attacks, combat flows smoothly
- **Potions**: Large slots (70px), top-right position, matches relic design perfectly

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Enemy attacks every turn
- [x] Weak status reduces enemy damage by 50%
- [x] Stun status makes enemy skip turn
- [x] Potion inventory displays correctly
- [x] Potion slots match relic slot size (70px)
- [x] Potion hover effects work
- [x] Potion tooltips appear in correct position
- [x] 3 potion slots arranged vertically
- [x] Border and background match relic inventory

---

### Notes

1. **Enemy Patterns**: The complex enemy attack patterns (confuse, strengthen, etc.) are still defined in enemy data but are currently not implemented. Future updates could add these mechanics back with proper handling.

2. **Potion Inventory**: Now perfectly matches the relic inventory design language, creating visual consistency across the UI.

3. **Combat Balance**: With enemies always attacking, combat is more aggressive. Status effects (Stun, Weak) become more important for survival.

### Future Considerations

1. Consider adding back enemy defend actions with proper implementation
2. Consider implementing complex enemy patterns (confuse, strengthen, etc.)
3. Add potion sprites to replace emoji icons (currently using emoji)
4. Add sound effects for potion use
