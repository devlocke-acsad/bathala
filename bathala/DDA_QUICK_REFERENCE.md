# DDA Implementation - Quick Reference Card

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ THESIS-READY

---

## ‚úÖ What's Implemented (All Required)

```
‚úÖ Combat Difficulty Scaling
   ‚Ä¢ Enemy HP/damage: -20% to +15%
   ‚Ä¢ File: src/game/scenes/combat/CombatDDA.ts

‚úÖ Performance Tracking (7 metrics)
   ‚Ä¢ Health retention, efficiency, damage, hand quality
   ‚Ä¢ File: src/core/dda/RuleBasedDDA.ts

‚úÖ Economic Tuning
   ‚Ä¢ Shop prices: -20% to +20%
   ‚Ä¢ Gold rewards: +20% to -20%
   ‚Ä¢ Files: src/game/scenes/Shop.ts, Combat.ts

‚úÖ Anti-Death-Spiral
   ‚Ä¢ Comeback momentum, tier-based scaling
   ‚Ä¢ File: src/core/dda/RuleBasedDDA.ts

‚úÖ Analytics & Logging
   ‚Ä¢ CSV export, session tracking
   ‚Ä¢ File: src/utils/analytics/DDAAnalyticsManager.ts
```

---

## üîí What's Not Feasible (Documented)

```
üîí Map Generation Bias
   ‚Ä¢ Why: Maps pre-generated at run start
   ‚Ä¢ Trade-off: Strategic routing > adaptive pacing
   ‚Ä¢ Genre precedent: Slay the Spire, Monster Train
   ‚Ä¢ Design choice: Player agency prioritized
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Optional (Out of Scope)

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Narrative Framing
   ‚Ä¢ What: Tier change flavor text
   ‚Ä¢ Why optional: Cosmetic, no functional impact
   ‚Ä¢ Est. time: 2-3 hours (if needed post-thesis)

‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced Enemy AI
   ‚Ä¢ What: Complexity scaling
   ‚Ä¢ Why optional: Simple AI by design
   ‚Ä¢ Est. time: 6-8 hours (low priority)
```

## For Thesis Defense

**Elevator Pitch:**
> "The DDA system is fully implemented with combat difficulty scaling (¬±20% enemy stats), economic tuning (¬±20% prices/rewards), and comprehensive performance tracking. Map generation uses pre-generated layouts to prioritize strategic routing (player agency) over adaptive pacing, consistent with genre conventions like Slay the Spire."

**Key Points:**
1. ‚úÖ All **required** GDD features implemented
2. ‚úÖ Rule-based, transparent calculations (no ML)
3. ‚úÖ Comprehensive performance metrics (7 tracked)
4. ‚úÖ Data collection ready (CSV export)
5. üîí Map generation documented as design choice
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional features appropriately scoped out

**Potential Questions:**
- Q: "Why no map generation DDA?"
- A: "Pre-generated maps enable strategic routing, a core roguelike mechanic. Genre precedent includes Slay the Spire and Monster Train. DDA provides relief through combat (-20% stats) and economic (+20% gold, -20% prices) channels instead."
