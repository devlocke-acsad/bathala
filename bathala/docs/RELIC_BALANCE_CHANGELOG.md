# Relic Balance Changelog v1.0

## Date: 2025-10-20
## Objective: Balance all relic effects to be impactful but not game-breaking

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è BALANCE METHODOLOGY

### Combat Scale Analysis
- **Player HP**: 120
- **Enemy Damage**: 12-45 per turn
- **Average Combat**: 5-8 turns
- **Hand Bonuses**: +3 (Pair) to +40 (Royal Flush)
- **Target**: 10-15% power increase per relic (not 50%+)

### Balance Targets
1. **Defensive relics** should mitigate 30-50% damage (not 80-100%)
2. **Offensive relics** should provide 10-20% damage boost (not 50%+)
3. **Utility relics** should enhance strategy (not trivialize decisions)
4. **Healing relics** should be < enemy damage per turn
5. **Economy relics** should provide modest advantage (not break shop)

## üìã COMPLETE CHANGES LIST

### üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSIVE RELICS

```diff
- Start: +12 Block, Per Turn: +2 Block
+ Start: +5 Block, Per Turn: +1 Block

```diff
- Start: +15 Block, Defend: +6 Block
+ Start: +5 Block, Defend: +3 Block

+ Block per Lupa card: +2

Impact: ~33% reduction

+ Defend Bonus: +3 Block

Impact: ~40% reduction
Rationale: +5 was stacking too well with other defensive relics

### ‚öîÔ∏è OFFENSIVE RELICS

#### Ember Fetish
```diff
- No Block: +4 Strength, With Block: +2 Strength
+ No Block: +2 Strength, With Block: +1 Strength

```

#### Tiyanak Tear
```diff
- Strength per Turn: +2
+ Strength per Turn: +1

Impact: ~50% reduction
Rationale: +10 Strength by turn 5 was exponential scaling

## üöÄ TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Solo Relic Testing**: Test each relic individually in combat
   - Does it feel impactful but not overpowered?
   - Can you still lose with this relic?

2. **Synergy Testing**: Test relic combinations
   - 2-3 defensive relics: Can you still take meaningful damage?
   - 2-3 offensive relics: Can you one-shot enemies?
   - Mixed builds: Do they feel balanced?

3. **Difficulty Testing**: Play full runs
   - Early game: Do relics feel helpful without trivializing?
   - Mid game: Do synergies create interesting builds?
   - Late game: Do stacked relics maintain challenge?

4. **Edge Case Testing**
   - All defensive relics: Still challenging?
   - All offensive relics: Still need to block?
   - No relics: Still winnable with skill?

---

## üìù NOTES

### Design Philosophy
**"Relics should make you feel powerful, not invincible"**
- Each relic provides a meaningful advantage (10-15%)
- Multiple relics create interesting synergies (30-50% total)
- Core mechanics (blocking, hand management) remain important
- Skill expression preserved (can't auto-win with relics alone)

### Future Considerations
- Monitor player feedback on relic power levels
- Track win rates with different relic combinations
- Consider introducing "cursed" relics with trade-offs
- Potential for relic upgrades/evolution system
