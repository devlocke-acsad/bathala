---

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features (100% of Required)

### 1. Combat Difficulty Scaling
**GDD Requirement:** Enemy stats scale by difficulty tier  
**Implementation:** `src/game/scenes/combat/CombatDDA.ts`

| Tier | HP/Damage Multiplier | Status |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| Struggling (0) | 0.8√ó (-20%) | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| Learning (1-2) | 1.0√ó (baseline) | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| Thriving (3-4) | 1.15√ó (+15%) | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| Mastering (5) | 1.15√ó (+15%) | ‚úÖ Implemented |

### 2. Player Performance Score (PPS)
**GDD Requirement:** Measurable performance tracking  
**Implementation:** `src/core/dda/RuleBasedDDA.ts`

**7 Comprehensive Metrics:**
1. ‚úÖ Health Retention (primary roguelike metric)
2. ‚úÖ Combat Efficiency (tier-based turn expectations)
3. ‚úÖ Damage Efficiency (DPT vs expectations)
4. ‚úÖ Hand Quality (poker hand achievement)
5. ‚úÖ Resource Management (discard usage)
6. ‚úÖ Clutch Performance (low HP bonus)
7. ‚úÖ Comeback Momentum (anti-death-spiral)

### 3. Calibration Period
**GDD Requirement:** First 3 combats observe without adjusting  
**Implementation:** `src/core/dda/RuleBasedDDA.ts` (lines 93-148)

- ‚úÖ PPS tracked during calibration
- ‚úÖ Tier locked to Learning (1.0√ó)
- ‚úÖ Applies calculated tier after combat #3
- ‚úÖ Prevents premature difficulty spikes

### 4. Economic Tuning
**GDD Requirement:** Shop prices and gold rewards adjust  
**Implementation:** 
- `src/game/scenes/Shop.ts` (Oct 19, 2025)
- `src/game/scenes/Combat.ts` (Oct 19, 2025)

| Tier | Shop Prices | Gold Rewards |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Struggling | 0.8√ó (-20%) | 1.2√ó (+20%) |
| Learning | 1.0√ó (baseline) | 1.0√ó (baseline) |
| Thriving | 1.1√ó (+10%) | 0.9√ó (-10%) |
| Mastering | 1.2√ó (+20%) | 0.8√ó (-20%) |

### 5. Anti-Death-Spiral Systems
**GDD Requirement:** Prevent negative feedback loops  
**Implementation:** `src/core/dda/RuleBasedDDA.ts`

- ‚úÖ Performance-based assessment (not win/loss)
- ‚úÖ Comeback momentum bonuses (+0.3 to +0.45)
- ‚úÖ Tier-based penalty scaling (50% reduction when struggling)
- ‚úÖ Clutch performance recognition (+0.2 bonus)

### 6. Analytics & Logging
**GDD Requirement:** Thesis validation data collection  
**Implementation:** `src/utils/analytics/DDAAnalyticsManager.ts`

- ‚úÖ PPS history tracking
- ‚úÖ Tier transition logging
- ‚úÖ Economic adjustment tracking
- ‚úÖ CSV export for statistical analysis
- ‚úÖ Session-based data collection

## üîí Architectural Limitations (Documented)

### Map Generation Bias
**GDD Language:** "can be weighted", "chance for" (optional, not required)  
**Status:** üîí Not Feasible

**Why:**
- Maps pre-generated at run start (all 7 layers at once)
- DDA tier changes during run (after map already exists)
- Layer-by-layer generation would require:
  - Removing strategic routing (core roguelike mechanic)
  - 4-6 hours refactoring + extensive playtesting
  - Fog-of-war or hidden layers (removes player agency)

**Design Rationale:**
> Pre-generated maps prioritize player agency and strategic routing over adaptive pacing. This aligns with genre conventions (Slay the Spire, Monster Train) and enables informed decision-making, a core roguelike skill. DDA provides difficulty relief through combat (-20% stats) and economic (+20% gold, -20% prices) channels, which have more immediate impact.

**For Thesis:**
- Document as intentional design choice
- Cite genre precedents (Slay the Spire uses pre-generated maps)
- Emphasize player agency trade-off

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional Enhancements (Out of Scope)

### 1. Narrative Framing
**GDD Language:** "The DDA is framed in-world..."  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional (flavor text)

**What it would add:**
- Tier change messages: "The spirits assess your capabilities..."
- Contextual flavor: "Your skill draws fiercer opponents..."

**Why out of scope:**
- Pure cosmetic feature
- No impact on DDA functionality
- Not required for thesis validation
- Can be added post-thesis if desired

### 2. Advanced Enemy AI
**GDD Language:** "likely to use", "more complex patterns"  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional (not defined)

**Why out of scope:**
- Simple intent-based AI is intentional design choice
- Poker hand mechanics provide strategic complexity
- HP/damage scaling already differentiates difficulty
- Implementation cost: 6-8 hours for enemy AI refactor
- Limited impact compared to stat scaling

**Current System:**
- ‚úÖ Enemy HP/damage scales by tier (sufficient difficulty variance)
- ‚úÖ Intent system is clear and readable (player understanding)
- ‚úÖ Poker mechanics provide strategic depth

## Thesis Validation Checklist

### ‚úÖ Research Question Addressed
> "How can a rule-based adaptive difficulty system be designed to maintain a state of 'flow' for players of varying skill levels in a strategic roguelike game?"

**System Demonstrates:**
1. ‚úÖ Rule-based calculations (transparent, no ML)
2. ‚úÖ Performance measurement (7 comprehensive metrics)
3. ‚úÖ Adaptive responses (combat + economic)
4. ‚úÖ Flow maintenance (difficulty scales with skill)
5. ‚úÖ Anti-frustration (death spiral prevention)

### ‚úÖ Data Collection Capabilities
- ‚úÖ Per-combat PPS tracking
- ‚úÖ Tier transition logging

2. **Economic Tuning**: Provides resource relief/challenge over time
3. **Performance Metrics**: Roguelike-appropriate (health retention focus)
4. **Anti-Death-Spiral**: Critical for fair adaptive difficulty

**Why Not Map Generation:**
- Pre-generated maps enable strategic routing (core roguelike mechanic)
- Genre precedent: Slay the Spire, Monster Train use similar systems
- Trade-off: Player agency vs adaptive pacing (chose agency)

**Why Not Advanced AI:**
- Poker hand mechanics provide strategic complexity
- Simple intent-based AI is intentional (clarity and readability)
- HP/damage scaling sufficient for difficulty variance
