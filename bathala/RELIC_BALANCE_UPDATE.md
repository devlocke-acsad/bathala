# Relic Balance Update - Combat-Scaled Adjustments

## Overview
Complete rebalancing of all relic effects to be **impactful but not game-breaking**, considering the combat scale:
- **Player HP**: 120
- **Enemy Damage**: 12-45 per turn
- **Hand Bonuses**: +3 (Pair) to +40 (Royal Flush)
- **Hand Multipliers**: 1.2x - 2.8x

## Balance Philosophy
1. **No single relic should negate core mechanics** (e.g., damage or hand management)
2. **Effects should feel rewarding without trivializing difficulty**
3. **Synergies should be interesting, not overpowered**
4. **Trade-offs and strategic decisions preserved**

## Expected Gameplay Impact

### Before Rebalancing
- **Player could easily stack 40+ Block per turn** → Nearly invincible
- **Hand management trivial** with 5 discards + 9-card hands
- **Healing exceeded enemy damage** → No threat of death
- **Single relics provided 20-30% power increase** → Snowball too strong

### After Rebalancing
- **Block scaling manageable** (10-20 per turn) → Enemy damage still threatening
- **Hand management matters** (4 discards, 8 cards) → Strategic choices preserved
- **Healing < Enemy damage** → Must block/avoid damage actively
- **Relics provide 10-15% power increase** → Meaningful but fair scaling
