**Date**: October 19, 2025

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Random lines behind titles** - Removed all decorative elements  
✅ **Black overlay on progress** - Changed to transparent background

## Files Changed

2. `ProgressIndicator.ts` - Made background transparent, removed glows
3. `Dialogue.ts` - Fixed overflow, changed to arrow indicator

## Key Changes

### Dialogue Box (Overflow Fix)
```typescript
fontSize: 22,              // Was 24
wordWrap: width * 0.65,    // Was 0.7
boxWidth: Math.min(width * 0.70, 900),  // Was 0.75, no max
boxHeight: Math.min(textHeight + 100, height * 0.7),  // Added max
continueIndicator: '▼'     // Was "Click to Continue"
```

### Progress Bar (No Black Overlay)
```typescript
background: 0x556065 at 0.3 alpha  // Was 0x2A2A2A at 0.8
border: 0x556065 at 0.5 alpha      // Was 1.0 alpha
// Removed: progressGlow, dot backgrounds, pulse animations
```

### Phase Header (No Random Lines)
```typescript
// Removed: decorative lines, corners, shadow, underline, animations
// Kept: title text only
```

## Result

- **Cleaner**: Minimal, focused UI
- **Readable**: Text always fits on screen
- **Consistent**: Matches intro design
- **Performant**: Fewer elements to render
