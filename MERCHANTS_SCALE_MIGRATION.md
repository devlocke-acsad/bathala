# Merchant's Scale Migration to Treasure System

## Overview
Successfully moved **Merchant's Scale** from the Shop to Treasure nodes with a weighted random appearance system (30% chance).

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed from Shop System**

#### ShopItems.ts
- ❌ Removed `merchants_scale` from `shopRelics` array
- ✅ Added comment explaining migration to treasure system
- **Result**: Merchant's Scale no longer appears in shop inventory

#### Shop.ts
- ❌ Removed merchant_scale merchant dialogue (lines 56-60)
- ❌ Removed merchant_scale lore case (line 1638)
- ✅ Shop still uses `RelicManager.calculateShopPriceReduction()` for discount calculation
- **Result**: Shop code cleaned up, discount system still functional

---

### 2. **Added to Treasure System**

#### Act1Relics.ts, Act2Relics.ts, Act3Relics.ts
**Added to treasureRelics arrays:**
```typescript
{
  id: "merchants_scale",
  name: "Merchant's Scale",
  description: "A balance blessed by Lakambini to ensure fair trade. All shop items are 20% cheaper.",
  emoji: "⚖️"
}
```

**Removed from shopRelics arrays:**
- All three acts now have consistent relic placement
- Added comments explaining the migration

---

### 3. **Weighted Random System in Treasure.ts**

#### New Logic (30% Appearance Rate)
```typescript
init(data: { player: Player }) {
  // Filter out relics player already has
  const availableRelics = treasureRelics.filter(
    relic => !this.player.relics.some(r => r.id === relic.id)
  );
  
  // Separate merchants_scale for weighted selection
  const merchantsScale = availableRelics.find(r => r.id === 'merchants_scale');
  const otherRelics = availableRelics.filter(r => r.id !== 'merchants_scale');
  
  // Create weighted pool
  let weightedPool: Relic[] = [];
  
  // Add other relics normally (70% weight)
  weightedPool = weightedPool.concat(otherRelics, otherRelics);
  
  // Add merchants_scale with 30% chance
  if (merchantsScale && Math.random() < 0.3) {
    weightedPool.push(merchantsScale);
  }
  
  // Shuffle and select 3 unique relics
  const shuffled = this.shuffleArray(weightedPool);
  const uniqueRelics: Relic[] = [];
  const seenIds = new Set<string>();
  
  for (const relic of shuffled) {
    if (!seenIds.has(relic.id) && uniqueRelics.length < 3) {
      uniqueRelics.push(relic);
      seenIds.add(relic.id);
    }
  }
  
  this.relicOptions = uniqueRelics;
}
```

#### Relic Acquisition Integration
```typescript
private selectRelic(relic: Relic, selectedButton: Phaser.GameObjects.Container): void {
  // Add relic to player
  this.player.relics.push(relic);
  
  // Apply immediate effects using RelicManager
  RelicManager.applyRelicAcquisitionEffect(relic.id, this.player);
  
  // Persist and return to overworld
  const gameState = GameState.getInstance();
  gameState.updatePlayerData(this.player);
  // ... rest of return logic
}
```

## Game Design Impact

### **Before Migration**
- 🛒 Merchant's Scale available in every shop for 200 ginto
- 💰 Predictable acquisition - players could always buy it if they had gold
- ⚖️ Made shops significantly cheaper once purchased

### **After Migration**
- 🎲 **30% chance** to appear in treasure chests
- 🎁 **FREE** when found (no cost)
- 🔮 **Rare encounter** - more valuable and exciting to find
- 🏪 Shops remain normal priced until found
- 🎯 **Strategic value increased** - can't rely on always having it

---

## Probability Analysis

### Treasure Node Appearance Rates
Given a treasure node encounter:

- **Other Relics**: ~70% chance to appear in each slot
- **Merchant's Scale**: ~30% chance to appear (if not already owned)

### Expected Encounters to Find
- **Average**: ~3-4 treasure nodes to see Merchant's Scale
- **Min**: Could appear in first treasure
- **Max**: May not appear at all in a run (adds roguelike variance)

---

## Integration Points

### Shop System Still Works
✅ **Price Calculation**: `RelicManager.calculateShopPriceReduction(price, player)`
- Checks if player has `merchants_scale` relic
- Returns 80% of original price (20% discount)
- All shop UI shows discounted prices correctly

✅ **Visual Feedback**:
- Original price shown with strikethrough
- Discounted price in green
- "Merchant's Scale!" label on purchases

### Treasure System Enhanced
✅ **Relic Effects**: `RelicManager.applyRelicAcquisitionEffect(relicId, player)`
- Applies immediate effects when relic is picked up
- Works for all relics (healing, stat boosts, etc.)
- Consistent with shop acquisition behavior

---

## Testing Checklist

### Shop Tests
- [x] Merchant's Scale removed from shop inventory
- [x] Shop loads without merchants_scale dialogue errors
- [x] Price discount still works if player has the relic
- [x] Shop UI displays correctly without the item

### Treasure Tests
- [ ] Merchant's Scale appears in treasure options (30% rate)
- [ ] Can successfully acquire Merchant's Scale from treasure
- [ ] Subsequent shops show 20% discount after acquisition
- [ ] Merchant's Scale doesn't appear if already owned
- [ ] Weighted random system works (other relics still appear)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Complete run: Find Merchant's Scale in treasure
- [ ] Verify discount works in next shop
- [ ] Verify relic acquisition effects apply correctly
- [ ] Verify no crashes when merchants_scale in treasure pool

## Configuration Options

### Adjustable Parameters

Want to change the appearance rate? Modify this line in `Treasure.ts`:
```typescript
if (merchantsScale && Math.random() < 0.3) {  // <-- Change 0.3 to adjust %
```

**Recommended Rates:**
- **0.2 (20%)** - Very rare, high value
- **0.3 (30%)** - Current setting, balanced
- **0.5 (50%)** - Common, easier to find
- **0.7 (70%)** - Almost guaranteed

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Act-Based Scaling**: Increase appearance rate in later acts

## Migration Status

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Branch**: `fix/refactoring_relics_implementation`

**Next Steps**: 
1. Manual testing in game
2. Balance adjustment if 30% rate feels wrong
3. Monitor player feedback on rarity
