## How to Play

### The Core Loop

Every adventure follows this pattern:

1. **Explore the Map**: Move across a grid-based world
2. **Enter Encounters**: Fight enemies, visit shops, rest at campsites
3. **Make Choices**: Spare or slay defeated enemies
4. **Improve Your Deck**: Remove weak cards, upgrade good ones
5. **Face the Boss**: After 5 complete day-night cycles
6. **Repeat**: Move to the next chapter or start a new run

### The Five-Cycle Countdown

Time in Bathala is measured in **actions**, not seconds:

- **1 Cycle = 100 Actions**
  - 50 actions during Day
  - 50 actions during Night
- **5 Cycles = 500 Actions** before the boss appears

**What counts as an action?**
- Moving on the map
- Entering battles
- Visiting shops or rest sites
- Any choice you make

**Strategy Tip**: Plan your route carefully! You want to be strong enough to face the boss by cycle 5.

### Day vs. Night

#### ☀️ **Day Phase**
- Enemies won't attack unless you approach them
- Better visibility on the map
- Standard shop prices
- Perfect time to explore and prepare

#### 🌙 **Night Phase**
- Enemies actively hunt you down
- Reduced map visibility
- More dangerous encounters
- Better rewards for taking risks

### Poker Hands Explained

Your poker hand determines your **bonus** and **multiplier**:

| Hand | Bonus | Multiplier | What You Need | Example |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|---------|
| **High Card** | +0 | ×1.0 | Nothing matches | A♠ K♥ 8♣ 5♦ 2♠ |
| **Pair** | +3 | ×1.2 | Two matching numbers | 7♥ 7♦ K♠ 5♣ 2♥ |
| **Two Pair** | +6 | ×1.3 | Two different pairs | J♠ J♦ 4♥ 4♣ A♠ |
| **Three of a Kind** | +10 | ×1.5 | Three matching numbers | 9♣ 9♥ 9♠ K♦ 3♣ |
| **Straight** | +12 | ×1.6 | Five in a row | 5♠ 6♥ 7♦ 8♣ 9♠ |
| **Flush** | +15 | ×1.7 | Five same element | 2♥ 5♥ 8♥ J♥ K♥ |

***Requires special relic: Diwata's Crown**

**How Damage Works**:
```
Final Damage = (Card Values + Bonus + Status Effects) × Multiplier × Action Modifier
```

**Card Values** (Base Chips):
- 1 (Ace) = 6
- 2-3 = 2
- 4-5 = 3
- 6-7 = 4
- 8-9 = 5
- 10, Jack, Queen, King = 6-7

### Your Three Actions

#### ⚔️ **Attack**
- **What it does**: Damage the enemy
- **Formula**: (Card Values + Bonus + Strength) × Multiplier
- **Best used**: When you have high-value cards and a strong hand

**Example**: 
- Cards: 7+7+7+6+6 = 33 base value
- Three of a Kind: +10 bonus, ×1.5 multiplier
- Calculation: (33 + 10) × 1.5 = 64 damage

#### 🛡️ **Defend**
- **What it does**: Gain Block (absorbs damage)
- **Formula**: (Card Values + Bonus + Dexterity) × Multiplier × 0.8
- **Carries over**: Leftover block stays for next turn (reduced to 50%)
- **Defense Modifier**: ×0.8 (slightly less efficient than attack)

**Example**:
- Cards: 7+7+7+6+6 = 33 base value
- Three of a Kind: +10 bonus, ×1.5 multiplier
- Calculation: (33 + 10) × 1.5 × 0.8 = 51 Block

#### ⚡ **Special**
- **What it does**: Applies your element's unique effect + reduced damage
- **Formula**: (Card Values + Bonus + Elemental Bonus) × Multiplier × 0.6
- **Unlimited uses**: Can use every turn!
- **Element-specific effects**:
  - 🔥 Apoy: Burn damage over time
  - 💧 Tubig: Heal yourself
  - 🌍 Lupa: Gain Strength (more damage)
  - 💨 Hangin: Gain Dexterity (more defense)
- **Special Modifier**: ×0.6 (deals less direct damage but has elemental effects)

### Status Effects Simplified

**Good for You**:
- **Strength**: Your attacks do more damage
- **Dexterity**: You block more damage
- **Block**: Absorbs damage before it hurts you

**Bad for You**:
- **Burn**: Lose health each turn
- **Weak**: Your attacks do less damage (-25%)
- **Vulnerable**: You take more damage (+50%)
- **Stun**: Skip your next turn
- **Seal**: Can't use Special actions
- **Fear**: Randomly discard cards

### The Discard Button

**What it does**: Lets you throw away up to 5 cards and draw new ones

**Uses**: You start with **3 discards per combat** (some items give you more)

**When to use it**:
- Your 8 cards are all terrible
- You need a specific element
- Hunting for a better poker hand
- Emergency situations
- You have 2-3 charges left to experiment

**When to save it**:
- Your cards are already good
- Fighting a boss (save for critical moments)
- You have only 1 discard left

---

## Building Your Deck

Unlike most card games where you keep adding cards, Bathala is about **refinement**. You start with 52 cards and make them better.

### The Three Ways to Improve

#### 💀 **Purify (Remove Cards)**
**Where**: Shops  
**Cost**: 50-100 gold per card  
**What it does**: Permanently removes a card from your deck

**Why remove cards?**
- Smaller deck = more consistent hands
- Get rid of weak low-value cards (1, 2, 3)
- Focus on your favorite elements
- Make room for better cards

**Beginner Strategy**:
1. Remove all "1" value cards first (4 cards)
2. Remove all "2" and "3" value cards (8 more cards)
3. You've removed 12 cards—already much better!

#### ✨ **Attune (Upgrade Cards)**
**Where**: Rest Sites (campsites)  
**Cost**: Free!  
**What it does**: Transforms a card into a higher-value card of the **same element**

**Example**: Fire-5 → Fire-9 → Fire-13

**Strategy**:
- Focus on one or two elements
- Turn weak cards into face cards (11, 12, 13)
- The higher the value, the better your hands

#### ➕ **Infuse (Add Cards)**
**Where**: Elite and Boss rewards (rare!)  
**Cost**: Free (it's a reward)  
**What it does**: Adds a powerful new card

**Warning**: Don't add too many cards! Quality over quantity.

### Deck Building Strategies

#### **Beginner-Friendly: Balanced Deck**
- Keep all four elements
- Remove only the lowest cards (1-3)
- Final size: 40-44 cards
- **Pro**: Works in any situation
- **Con**: Less powerful than focused decks

#### **Intermediate: Dual-Element**
- Choose two elements (e.g., Fire + Earth)
- Remove all cards from the other two
- Upgrade your chosen elements
- Final size: 30-36 cards
- **Pro**: Strong and flexible
- **Con**: Needs planning

#### **Advanced: Mono-Element**
- Keep only one element
- Remove everything else
- Maximum upgrade focus
- Final size: 24-30 cards
- **Pro**: Most powerful element effects
- **Con**: Vulnerable to counters, expensive

#### **Expert: Face Card Focus**
- Keep mostly 10, 11, 12, 13 value cards
- Upgrade lower cards to faces
- Remove all low values
- Final size: 20-26 cards
- **Pro**: Consistently strong hands
- **Con**: Very expensive, hard early game

### Deck Size Guide

| Size | Consistency | Power | Difficulty |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|
| 20-26 cards | Excellent | High | Expert |
| 28-34 cards | Very Good | Medium-High | Intermediate |
| 36-42 cards | Good | Medium | Beginner |
| 44-52 cards | Fair | Low-Medium | Starter |
