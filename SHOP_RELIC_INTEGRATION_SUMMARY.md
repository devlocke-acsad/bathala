# Shop and RelicManager Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the `RelicManager` into the `Shop` scene to properly apply relic-based price discounts and acquisition effects.

## Changes Made

### 1. Shop.ts Integration

#### Added Import
```typescript
import { RelicManager } from "../../core/managers/RelicManager";
```

#### New Helper Method
```typescript
/**
 * Calculate the actual price for an item after applying relic discounts
 */
private getActualPrice(item: ShopItem): number {
  return RelicManager.calculateShopPriceReduction(item.price, this.player);
}
```

#### Updated Methods

**buyItem()** - Now checks actual discounted price:
```typescript
// Calculate actual price with relic discounts
const actualPrice = this.getActualPrice(item);

// Check if player can afford the item
if (item.currency === "ginto" && this.player.ginto < actualPrice) {
  this.showMessage("Not enough Ginto!", "#ff4757");
  return;
}
```

**showPurchaseConfirmation()** - Shows both original and discounted prices:
- Displays original price with strikethrough when Merchant's Scale is active
- Shows discounted price in green
- Adds "Merchant's Scale!" label to indicate discount source

**proceedWithPurchase()** - Deducts actual price and applies relic effects:
```typescript
// Calculate actual price with discounts
const actualPrice = this.getActualPrice(item);

// Deduct currency
if (item.currency === "ginto") {
  this.player.ginto -= actualPrice;
}

// Apply any immediate relic acquisition effects
RelicManager.applyRelicAcquisitionEffect(item.item.id, this.player);
```

**Item Card Display** - Shows discounted price:
- Main price displayed uses actual (discounted) price
- Price text shown in green when discounted
- Original price shown with strikethrough if discounted

**Tooltip Display** - Enhanced with discount information:
- Shows "DISCOUNTED" label instead of "PRICE" when Merchant's Scale is active
- Displays original price with strikethrough
- Shows discounted price in green with larger font

### 2. RelicManager.ts Refactoring

#### Removed Unused Method
- Removed `isFirstShopItemFree()` - was not implemented and always returned `false`

#### Existing Methods (Verified Used)
All these methods are actively used in Combat.ts:
- ✅ `calculateShopPriceReduction()` - Now used in Shop.ts
- ✅ `applyRelicAcquisitionEffect()` - Now used in Shop.ts
- ✅ `shouldApplyWeakStatus()` - Used in status effect application
- ✅ `shouldApplyFearStatus()` - Used in status effect application  
- ✅ `shouldIgnoreCurse()` - Used in status effect application
- ✅ `calculateBungisngisGrinDamage()` - Used for elemental damage calculations
- ✅ `tryKapresCigarSummon()` - Used at start of combat
- ✅ All start-of-combat/turn/end-of-turn effect methods

### 3. Unit Tests Created

Created comprehensive unit tests in `RelicManager.test.ts`:

**Test Suites:**
1. `calculateShopPriceReduction` - 4 tests
   - Returns original price when no relics
   - Returns 20% reduced price with merchants_scale
   - Handles multiple shop relics stacking
   - Prevents price from going below zero

2. `applyRelicAcquisitionEffect` - 6 tests
   - Adds persistent block for earthwardens_plate
   - Heals player for blessed_amulet
   - Increases max HP for blessed_amulet
   - Prevents exceeding max health when healing
   - Handles passive relics without immediate effects
   - Handles shop relics without immediate effects

3. `applyStartOfCombatEffects` - 4 tests
   - Applies persistent block from earthwardens_plate
   - Grants extra discard charge from swift_wind_agimat
   - Stacks multiple start-of-combat effects
   - Handles player with no combat-start relics

4. `Edge Cases` - 4 tests
   - Handles undefined relics array gracefully
   - Handles duplicate relics in array
   - Handles empty relics array
   - Handles zero price

## Visual Improvements

### Merchant's Scale Active
- **Card Display**: Price shown in green with original price struck through
- **Purchase Dialog**: Original price + discounted price with "Merchant's Scale!" label
- **Tooltip**: "DISCOUNTED" header with both prices clearly shown

### No Discount
- Standard white/gold price display
- No strikethrough or discount indicators

## Technical Benefits

1. **Centralized Logic**: All relic price calculations now go through `RelicManager`
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Same discount applies to all price displays (card, tooltip, confirmation)
3. **Proper Relic Effects**: Acquisition effects (healing, stat boosts) now trigger on purchase
4. **Type Safety**: All methods use proper TypeScript types
5. **Testability**: Comprehensive unit tests ensure relic effects work correctly
6. **No Code Duplication**: Single source of truth for price calculation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Bargain Talisman**: Implement first-item-free functionality (requires game state tracking)
2. **Shop Statistics**: Track total savings with Merchant's Scale
3. **Discount Stacking**: Support multiple shop discount relics
4. **Visual Effects**: Add particle effects when purchasing with discount
5. **Achievement Integration**: "Savvy Shopper" achievement for X amount saved

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Unit tests pass for `calculateShopPriceReduction`
- [x] Unit tests pass for `applyRelicAcquisitionEffect`
- [x] Unit tests pass for `applyStartOfCombatEffects`
- [x] Price displays correctly on item cards
- [x] Price displays correctly in tooltips
- [x] Price displays correctly in purchase confirmation
- [x] Actual discounted price is deducted from player currency
- [ ] Manual test: Buy Merchant's Scale, verify next shop has discounts
- [ ] Manual test: Buy relic with acquisition effect (e.g., earthwardens_plate), verify effect applies
- [ ] Manual test: Enter combat with earthwardens_plate, verify starting block

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are additive or internal refactoring.

### Backwards Compatibility
Full backwards compatibility maintained. Shops without relics work exactly as before.

### Performance Impact
Negligible - single `find()` operation per price calculation.
